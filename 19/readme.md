# The Challenge

> 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
> Thirty days has September,
> April, June and November.
> All the rest have thirty-one,
> Saving February alone,
> Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
> And on leap years, twenty-nine.
> A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
> How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## My Thoughts

I decided I didn't want to use the datetime module because that would be **WAY** too easy.
I also like writing algorithms a lot ðŸ™ƒ. 
I am completely self-taught in computer science so let me know if there is anything I should change to be more inline with common conventions or if anything doesn't look pythonic.
I am also obviously super open to any optimization tips etc.

### Specifics

I programmed it so you only need to change a few lines to make it count the first-of-the-month Sundays from any year to any other year. It just needs adjusted slightly to take the first day of the starting year, the starting year, and the ending year from the user.
